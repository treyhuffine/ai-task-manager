**Parakeet TDT** is a high-performance implementation of NVIDIA's [Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3) model using [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/), designed for ultra-fast inference on CPU.

This implementation achieves exceptional real-time speeds, outperforming standard [openai/whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) and competing directly with GPU-accelerated [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) implementations while running entirely on consumer CPUs. The efficiency is achieved through the architectural advantages of the Token-and-Duration Transducer (TDT) model combined with 8-bit quantization.

## 🌍 Multilingual Support

**Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3** features robust multilingual capabilities with **automatic language detection**. The model can automatically identify and transcribe speech in any of the **25 supported languages** without requiring manual language specification:

English, Spanish, French, Russian, German, Italian, Polish, Ukrainian, Romanian, Dutch, Hungarian, Greek, Swedish, Czech, Bulgarian, Portuguese, Slovak, Croatian, Danish, Finnish, Lithuanian, Slovenian, Latvian, Estonian, Maltese

Simply send audio in any of these languages, and the model will automatically detect and transcribe it with high accuracy, including proper punctuation and capitalization.

## Benchmark

### LibriSpeech test-clean (Verified Ground Truth) ⭐

Benchmarked on **LibriSpeech test-clean** dataset with professionally verified human transcriptions. This provides reliable, reproducible accuracy metrics.

**Test Environment:** CPU-only inference, 50 samples (~350 seconds of audio)

| Model | Precision | Accuracy | WER | CER | Speedup (RTF) |
|-------|-----------|----------|-----|-----|---------------|
| **Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3** | INT8 | **97.84%** | 2.16% | 0.56% | **18.41x** (0.054) |
| **Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3** | FP16 | **97.84%** | 2.16% | 0.56% | **18.82x** (0.053) |
| **Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3** | FP32 | **97.84%** | 2.16% | 0.56% | **19.42x** (0.052) |
| Whisper Large v3* | FP16 | ~95-96% | ~4-5% | ~2-3% | varies |

> *Whisper Large v3 benchmarks from published literature on LibriSpeech test-clean. Actual results vary by implementation and hardware.

**Key Findings:**
- All Parakeet precision variants achieve **identical accuracy** (97.84%)
- INT8 quantization has **zero accuracy loss** vs FP32
- Real-time factor (RTF) of ~0.05 means 20x faster than real-time
- Competitive with Whisper Large v3 accuracy with significantly faster CPU inference

## Requirements

*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (Recommended)
*   Or: Python 3.10+ and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

### CPU Optimization
For hybrid CPUs (like Intel 12th-14th Gen), performance is significantly improved by pinning the process to Performance cores (P-cores).

## Installation

### 🐳 Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started. No dependencies to install!

**CPU Deployment:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/groxaxo/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-fastapi-openai
cd parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-fastapi-openai
docker compose up parakeet-cpu -d
```

**GPU Deployment** (requires [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)):
```bash
docker compose up parakeet-gpu -d
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:5092`. See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for more options.

---

### Conda (Alternative)

For development or customization:

```bash
conda create -n parakeet-onnx python=3.10
conda activate parakeet-onnx
git clone https://github.com/groxaxo/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-fastapi-openai
cd parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-fastapi-openai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Start the Server

Parakeet TDT provides an OpenAI-compatible API server.

```bash
conda activate parakeet-onnx
python app.py
```
*   **Port**: 5092
*   **Docs**: [http://127.0.0.1:5092/docs](http://127.0.0.1:5092/docs)

### Client Example (Python)

You can use the standard `openai` Python library to interact with the server.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://127.0.0.1:5092/v1",
    api_key="sk-no-key-required"
)

audio_file = open("audio.mp3", "rb")
transcript = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
  model="parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3",  # or "istupakov/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-onnx" or "grikdotnet/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-fp16"
  file=audio_file,
  response_format="text"
)

print(transcript)
```

### Model Selection

The API supports multiple model variants with different precision levels:

| Model Name | Precision | Speed | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3` | INT8 | Fastest | Default model with 8-bit quantization (recommended) |
| `istupakov/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-onnx` | FP32 | Slower | Full precision for maximum accuracy |
| `grikdotnet/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-fp16` | FP16 | Medium | Half precision, balanced speed and accuracy |

Models are lazy-loaded on first use and cached for subsequent requests. The default INT8 model is pre-loaded at startup.

**To select a model via API:**
```python
transcript = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
  model="grikdotnet/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-fp16",  # Select FP16 model
  file=audio_file,
  response_format="text"
)
```

### Web Interface

The server includes a built-in web interface for testing and easy drag-and-drop transcription.
Access it at: **[http://127.0.0.1:5092](http://127.0.0.1:5092)**

The web interface includes a dropdown menu to select between INT8, FP16, and FP32 model variants.

## Model details

When running the application, the ONNX models are automatically loaded from the `models/` directory. The primary model used is the **Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3** converted to ONNX with INT8 quantization, providing the optimal balance of speed and accuracy for multilingual speech recognition across 25 European languages.
